Libre.fm Coding Standards (Adapted from phpGroupWare standards)

Please comply with the following standard when working on Libre.fm if you 
want your patches accepted and modules included in supported releases.

1)	Format your code so that we can read it, please!

2)	Use tabs for formatting, NOT SPACES.  Tabs create smaller files and editors allow
	developers to view a tab as however many spaces as they prefer - we use 4 spaces.
	Spaces do not allow this.

3)	Use ' instead of " for strings, where substitutions aren't required.  This is a 
	performance issue, and prevents	a lot of inconsistent coding styles.  When using 
	substitutions, use curly braces around your variables - like so:
	$var = "my_var: {$my_var}";

4)	Comments go on the line ABOVE the code, NOT to the right of the code, unless it 
	is very short.

5)	All functions and methods are to be documented using PhpDocumentor - http://phpdoc.org

6)	Use switch statements where many else if's are going to be used.  Switch/case is faster

7)	'If' statements need to use the following format:

	if ($var == 'example')
	{
		echo 'This is only an example';
	} 
	else
	{
		echo 'This is not a test.  This is the real thing';
	}

	Do NOT make if statements like this:

	if ($var == 'example'){ echo 'An example'; }

	OR this

	if($var = 'example')
		echo "An {$var}";

8)	class/function format:

	/**
	 * This class is for testing
	 */
	class ModuleTesting 
	{
		/**
		 * Output the value of $my_var the user
		 */
		public function printToScreen()
		{
			$my_var = new Monkey();
			if ($my_var->name == 'example')
			{
				echo 'This is only an example';
			}
			else
			{
				echo 'This is not a test.  This is the real thing';
			}
		}
	}

10)	Associative arrays must be written in the following manner:

	$array = array 
	(
		'var'   => 'value',
		'var2'  => 'value2'
	);

	Note that spaces are preferred around the '=>'.

11)	Use the long format for <?php.  Do NOT use <?.

12)	a) Classes begin with a capital letter and use CamelCase for separating words (e.g. MyClass).
	b) Functions/Methods start with a lower case letter and use CamelCase for separating words (e.g. myFunction).
	c) Variables are all lower case and use _ for separating words (e.g. my_variable).

13)	Always use symbol based comparison operators (&&, ||) instead of text based
	operators (AND, OR) as they are evaluated in different orders and at different
	speeds.  This is will prevent any confusion or strange results.

14)	You code must run with E_ALL error reporting turned on, E_NOTICES are ERRORS!
	Where possible your code should run with E_STRICT error reporting.

15)	All variables, classes, methods, functions and comments must be in English.
	Bad english is easier to work with than having to babelfish code to work out
	how it works.

16)	Files should be in either ASCII or UTF-8 encoding with UNIX line endings.

17)	Files should not end with an ending php tag "?>".  Any whitespace after 
	the closing tag is sent to the browser and cause errors, so don't include
	them.

18)	If you see code which doesn't comply with the above, please fix it :)
