Introduction
------------

Lastscrape is a quick hack for pulling listened tracks from any Last.fm
profile library. It is written in Python and requires the BeautifulSoup
module.[1] Version 3.1 of it seems to be broken[2] so use version
3.0.7a.

How it works
------------

The script loads the page at <http://last.fm/user/PROFILE/tracks>,
where PROFILE is any Last.fm profile name. It checks how many pages the
library has, then loops through all of them, gathering all the tracks
you've listened.

The program outputs a TSV-formatted (tab-separated) list of the track data.

Usage
-----

You can simply run:

	./lastscrape.py USER [OUTPUT_FILE]

Output file is optional, but you may want to use it if your terminal encoding
is not UTF-8.

To save the track data in a file, you can run e.g.:

	./lastscrape.py USER trackdata.tsv
